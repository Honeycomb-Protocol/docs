# Getting Started

The currency manager works on top of the hive control and SPL Token program.

### JavaScript

```bash
yarn add @solana/web3.js \
        @solana/spl-token \
        @honeycomb-protocol/hive-control \
        @honeycomb-protocol/currency-manager
```

### Rust

```toml
hpl-currency-manager = { version="0.0.38", features = ["cpi"] }
```

## Dependencies

To integrate the Currency Manager Service and add currencies to your desired project, you would first need to load the specific project to which you wish to add the currencies.

```typescript
const connection = new Connection(...);
const honeycomb = new Honeycomb(connection);
honeycomb.use(
  await HoneycombProject.fromAddress(connection, new PublicKey(...))
)
```

## Creating Currencies

Creating a new currency is a straightforward process, as demonstrated in the following example:

```typescript
const bonk = await HplCurrency.new(honeycomb, {
  kind: PermissionedCurrencyKind.Custodial,
  decimals: 9,
  name: "Bonk Inu",
  symbol: "BONK",
  uri: "https://arweave.net/QPC6FYdUn-3V8ytFNuoCS85S2tHAuiDblh6u3CIZLsw",
});

// inject in honeycomb for better accessibility
honeycomb.use(bonk);
```

## Wrapping Currencies

you also have the option to wrap a token into a currency, allowing you to use existing tokens as in-game currencies. It enables seamless integration of external tokens into the Honeycomb gaming ecosystem.

```typescript
const bonk = await HplCurrency.new(honeycomb, {
  mint: new web3.PublicKey("DezXAZ8z7PnrnRJjz3wXBoRgixCa6xjnB7YaB1pPB263"),
});

// inject in honeycomb for better accessibility
honeycomb.use(bonk);
```
