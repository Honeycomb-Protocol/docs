# Integration

## Fetching the NFTs

To interact with the staking pool and perform staking-related operations, you can use the Honeycomb Protocol's Staking service. To get a list of NFTs available for staking or already staked in the pool, use the following methods:

```typescript
const availableNfts = await honeycomb.staking().fetch().availableNfts();
const stakedNfts = await honeycomb.staking().fetch().stakedNfts();
```

## Staking

Staking NFTs in a staking pool is a simple process with the Honeycomb Protocol. Use the following method to stake the available NFTs:

```typescript
await honeycomb.staking().stake(availableNfts);
```

## Claiming Rewards

Once NFTs are staked, users become eligible to claim rewards based on their staking duration and other configured multipliers. The Honeycomb Protocol allows users to claim their earned rewards easily:

```typescript
await honeycomb.staking().claim(stakedNfts);
```

## Unstaking

When users want to withdraw their staked NFTs along with any earned rewards, they can initiate the unstaking process using the following method:

```typescript
await honeycomb.staking().unstake(stakedNfts);
```
