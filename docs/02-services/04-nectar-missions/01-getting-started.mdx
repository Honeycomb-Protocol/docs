# Getting Started

### JavaScript

```bash
yarn add @solana/web3.js \
        @solana/spl-token \
        @honeycomb-protocol/hive-control \
        @honeycomb-protocol/currency-manager \
        @honeycomb-protocol/nectar-staking \
        @honeycomb-protocol/nectar-missions
```

### Rust

```toml
hpl-nectar-missions = { version="0.0.34", features = ["cpi"] }
```

## Dependencies

Before creating a missions pool for your project, it is necessary to load the project and its corresponding currencies. This ensures that the mission pool operates seamlessly with the required configurations and functionalities.

```typescript
const connection = new Connection(...);
const honeycomb = new Honeycomb(connection);
honeycomb.use(
  await HoneycombProject.fromAddress(connection, new PublicKey(...))
)
await findProjectCurrencies(honeycomb.project());
```

## Creating Mission Pool

You can create a mission pool by following this example:

```typescript
const project = honeycomb.project();
const collectionAddress = new PublicKey(...);

const factionsArray = nfts.map((nft) => ({
  faction: "faction",
  mint: nft.mint.address,
}));
const factionsMerkleTree = new MerkleTree(
  factionsArray.map(({ faction, mint }) =>
    Buffer.from([...Buffer.from(faction), ...mint.toBuffer()])
  )
);

const missionsPool = await NectarMissions.new(honeycomb, {
  args: {
    name: "Sol Patrol Missions",
    factionsMerkleRoot: factionsMerkleTree.getRootArray(),
    collections: [
      collectionAddress
    ],
    creators: []
  },
  project
})
honeycomb.use(missionsPool);
```

## Deep Dive

### Factions tree

The merkle tree for factions mapped with mints is required so that validations could be applied to factions with provability.
