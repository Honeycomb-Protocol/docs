# Introduction

## What is Honeycomb?

Honeycomb is a platform built on the Solana blockchain that streamlines the process for game developers to integrate NFTs, semi-fungible tokens, and in-game assets into web3 games. It enhances the gaming experience on the web3 platform through the use of Solana's efficient and secure network. Honeycomb also provides a Guild-Kit to support the creation and management of in-game web3 guilds, and aims to solve game development issues with its web3 matchmaking system and on-chain game state management system.

This platform is compatible with all of the [Metaplex](https://docs.metaplex.com/) NFT standards, including the Programmable Asset Class.

## The Problem

The Honeycomb protocol is being built for the Solana NFT gaming community by the development team [Solana Studio](https://www.solana.studio/). While working as the devs for various gaming related projects on the Solana network, it became clear that there were no developer friendly tools for Solana game-dev on the infrastructure level.\
\
We believe that the game life-cycle is made up the following core functionalities:

- Player profiles
- Fee structure
- Mutable digital assets
- Issue and manage digital assets
- Game tokens (custodial and non-custodial)
- Idle player rewards (Staking)
- Quests (Missions)
- Loot Boxes (Raffles)
- Guild or Party
- Match Making
- Game State Management

## The Solution

The aim of Honeycomb protocol is to simplify Solana game development by providing a set of [Programs](programs/) that handle all crucial game lifecycle functions and NFT composability. These Programs are managed with our <mark>Hive Control (Master Program)</mark> that manages the suite of tools that are offered by Honeycomb. All programs are designed to be modular, allowing for customization and integration with one another.

1. Asset Hub - manage game assets/tokens and NFT/SFT composability
2. Nectar Utilities - programs for various in-game utility
3. Buzz Kit - guilds, match-making and game-state management

## Preface

With over 12 months of development experience on the Solana network, our team ([Solana.Studio](https://www.solana.studio/)) will continue to create open-source tools and infrastructure for the Solana ecosystem. Our latest release was the first [Candy Machine v3 UI](https://github.com/Solana-Studio/Candy-Machine-V3-UI), which includes all candy-guards.&#x20;

We've decided for the recent Sandstorm Hackathon that we would begin designing and building an infrastructure level protocol with a focus on NFT composability. We are very excited to announce that we received first place in the gaming track for the hackathon!

This protocol will be continued to be developed and utilized as the infrastructure for a personal project we are building called [Sol Patrol](https://twitter.com/SolPatrolNFT).&#x20;
