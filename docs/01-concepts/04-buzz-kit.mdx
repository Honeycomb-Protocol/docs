# Buzz Kit

## Guild Kit Program

Ability to design in-game Guilds or a group of players used to represent an Alliance or Party.

Honeycomb allows for multiple NFTs from different holders to establish a membership, leadership and hierarchy within the Guild or Party. The protocol allows for players to easily form a group, send NFT's on missions or quests and share the loot within the organization.

The Guild Kit is currently in-development and is planned to launch in Q1 2024.
